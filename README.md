This project aims to find the optimum number of topics in a corpus and evaluate it by performing a classification task. The optimum number of topics is found using HDP. An LDA topic model is then trained using this topic number and the output(topic distribution) is fed into a classifier as the input. The classifier performance is evaluated using cross validation.
